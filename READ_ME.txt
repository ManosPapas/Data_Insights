You need Python + Jupyter Notebook.

All code was stored to GitHub.

If you need to install Python libraries check the folder libraries.

To run tests run the Tests.ipynb file

I saved mthe ML models in the Data_Insights\Analysis\Funding_Companies\Saved_Models

In the Analysis folder you will find the most interesting things. There you will find Jupyter notebooks (not for all projects, some projects where not done using Python). Run a notebook to run an analysis.

Notice that in some projects Python was not used, but I still wanted all the information to be in GitHub. 
Therefore, I pushed files like pdf + power BI files.

I am aware that this is not optimal, but I did it for the purpose of the dissertation.
In addition, you will see some Excel files in the Analysis folder. These files are there as they were used to create the Power BI files.

If you want to check the second project (dashboard) (Data Studio + Google Analytics) and interact with it follow this link: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/1NQobbi-C_wjuGuwCG1-xocX-6628a7I5/page/gbJq

if the link does not work it means they remove access rights (out of my control!)
